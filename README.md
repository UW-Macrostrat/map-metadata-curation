# map-metadata-curation
Work in 2023-4 to collect information about Macrostrat's existing sources

## Goals

- Curate information about who compiled Macrostrat maps and when
- Add raster image links to database
- Get a sense of which maps have point data, in both the `sources` schema and `points` schema.
  - See if any maps don't have point data, but it can be easily found online
